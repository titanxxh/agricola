#	What is this project?
**Agricola** is a remake for the world famous boardgame, [Agricola(2007)](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260/agricola), by Uwe Rosenberg.

The final goal of this project is to implement all cards of the new version(deck A,B,C,D).

I also want to learn javascript and frontend programming by building a boardgame project.

This project is still working in progress!

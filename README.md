#	What is this project?
**Agricola** is a remake for the world famous boardgame, [Agricola(2007)](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260/agricola), by Uwe Rosenberg.

The final goal of this project is to implement all cards of the new version(deck A,B,C,D). Ambitious, right? But life is hard! 

Due to the complexity of the interactions of so many card effects, I think itâ€™s impossible to perfectly constrain player from only doing valid actions, at least for the first iteration of my project it is not practical. 
More importantly, the first concern of my project is to build a Agricola game for my buddies and to record our game statistics. 
The way used in tabletop simulator (one can do all possible moves freely) is more practical. 
For convenience, game could provide some simple rules checking such as invalid fencing. 

I also want to learn javascript and frontend programming by building this boardgame project.

This project is still working in progress! (far away from releasing...)
